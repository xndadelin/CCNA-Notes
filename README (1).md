# Welcome

Welcome to my personal notebook for the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certification. Here, you are going to find the key topics and concepts I've been learning along the way. This space is for jotting down important networking principles, commands, and ideas in a way that makes sense to me as I prepare for the certification. From basic networking to more advanced concepts, these notes are my reference for everything I’m studying.

I’m learning through **Jeremy's IT Lab | Free CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**, and this notebook serves as a way to consolidate and organize the material I’m absorbing from his excellent lessons.
